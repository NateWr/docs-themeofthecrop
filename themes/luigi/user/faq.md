## <a name="logo"></a> How do I change the colors of my site?

To change the colors of your site, go to the **Appearance > Customize** page in your WordPress admin area. Open the **Theme Colors** section and use the color controls to change sections of your site.

Once you've finished, don't forget to click the **Save** button.

## <a name="footer-address"></a> How do I add my address to the bottom of my site?

Once you have filled out your **Business Profile**, your contact details will automatically appear at the bottom of your site, just like the demo.

You can learn more about how to fill out your business profile in the section on [recommended first steps](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/first-steps). If you haven't yet, be sure to take a look.

## <a name="homepage"></a> How do I build a homepage like the demo?

Luigi comes with a powerful tool to construct a gorgeous, effective landing page. Before you can use it, though, you'll need to have configured a Static Home Page. If you haven't done so, read the [recommended first steps](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/first-steps).

Once you've got your homepage set up, open the customizer from the **Appearance > Customize** link (you may already have the customizer open). When you're looking at the homepage in the customizer, you'll see a **Homepage Layout** section. Open that to begin working with the layout builder.

To add a component, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Add Component** button to open the list of available components. *If you are missing some of the [recommended plugins](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), you may be missing some components.**

2. Select a component from the list. Try the **Hero Block** first.

3. Click the small dropdown arrow in the newly added component to open the input form.<br>
	![Screenshot of the toggle to open a single component in the Homepage Layout control](/img/theme/{{ page.slug }}/homepage-builder-open-component.png)

4. Fill out the details in the component's form as desired and watch the view on the right update as you go.

5. You can repeat these steps adding as many different components as you'd like. When you're happy with how it looks, click the **Save & Publish** button at the top of the screen to publish your changes to the live site.

## <a name="menu"></a> How do I build my restaurant's menu?

This theme integrates with the free [Food and Drink Menu](https://wordpress.org/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/) plugin.

Once the plugin is [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), you can begin building your menus by going to the **Menu Items** page in your WordPress admin area.

Learn more by visiting the [plugin's documentation](/plugins/food-and-drink-menu) and don't miss the [Pro version](http://themeofthecrop.com/plugin/food-and-drink-menu-pro/).

## <a name="reservations"></a> How do I take reservations for my restaurant?

This theme integrates with the free [Restaurant Reservations](http://wordpress.org/plugins/restaurant-reservations/) plugin.

Once the plugin is [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), create a new page for your booking form. Then go to the **Bookings > Settings** page and select your **Booking Page**. The reservations form will automatically appear on this page.

You can also add the form to any page or post with the `[booking-form]` shortcode, or use the **Booking Form** widget to add it to a sidebar.

There's *so much more* you can do, from setting your booking schedule to configuring notifications. There are also *powerful addons* to [add custom fields](http://themeofthecrop.com/plugin/custom-fields-restaurant-reservations/), [build your mailing list](http://themeofthecrop.com/plugin/mailchimp-restaurant-reservations/) and [export bookings](http://themeofthecrop.com/plugin/export-bookings-for-restaurant-reservations/) to PDF/Excel files.

Be sure to read the [plugin's documentation](/plugins/restaurant-reservations).

## <a name="show-contact-details"></a> How do I display my restaurant's contact details?

This theme integrates with the free [Business Profile](http://wordpress.org/plugins/business-profile/) plugin.

Once the plugin is [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), open the **Business Profile** page in your WordPress admin area (*hint: it's way down near the bottom of the navigation menu on the left*). Fill out your restaurant's details.

Then just add the `[contact-card]` to any page or post, or use the **Contact Card** widget to display it in any sidebar.

Learn more by visiting the [plugin's documentation](/plugins/business-profile).

## <a name="reviews"></a> How do I add reviews of my restaurant?

This theme integrates with the free [Good Reviews for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/good-reviews-wp/) plugin.

Once the plugin is [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), go to the **Reviews** page in your WordPress admin area. From here you can add and edit reviews.

Learn more by visiting the [plugin's documentation](/plugins/good-reviews-wp).

## <a name="events"></a> How do I promote my restaurant's events?

This theme integrates with the free [Event Organiser](http://wordpress.org/plugins/event-organiser/) plugin.

Once the plugin is [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), go to the **Events** page in your WordPress admin area. From here you can add and edit events.

Then add the `[eo_fullcalendar]` shortcode to any page or post. I recommend you use a page with the [full-width page template](#full-width-page-template).

This plugin provides [extensive documentation](http://docs.wp-event-organiser.com/) as well as a [pro version](http://wp-event-organiser.com/) with more features.

## <a name="seo"></a> How do I improve my restaurant's SEO?

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a large and complex topic. But it is extraordinarily valuable for restaurants, cafes and bars.

If you haven't already, I recommend you install the [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) plugin, which gives you a number of useful tools to help you optimize your site.

Yoast has [written the book](https://yoast.com/wordpress-seo/) on Search Engine Optimization with WordPress. But learning how to make effective use of it can take time, and it may feel overwhelming if you've never encountered it before.

I've written a few guides that break down those aspects of SEO that I believe are most critical to restaurants:

- [Three fast steps to improve your restaurant SEO with Yoast](http://themeofthecrop.com/2015/02/17/three-fast-steps-improve-restaurant-seo-yoast/)
- [Tending your SEO garden with Google's Search Console](http://themeofthecrop.com/2015/08/31/tending-your-seo-garden-with-googles-search-console/)
- [But I'm big in Japan: local search for your restaurant website](http://themeofthecrop.com/2015/03/18/but-im-big-in-japan-local-search-for-your-restaurant-website/)

## <a name="social-profile-menu"></a> How do I add icons which link to my social media profiles?

This theme is configured to support a special navigation menu for your social media profiles.

To set this up, go to the **Appearance > Menus** page in your WordPress admin area. Create a navigation menu using the **Custom Links** type of menu component. Enter the link to your social media profile.

![Screenshot of the Custom Links option in the WordPress navigation menu setup](/img/theme/social-profile-menu-custom-link.png)

Once you've saved the links to your social media profiles, assign this menu to the **Social Profiles Menu** theme location.

![Screenshot of the Theme Location setting in the WordPress navigation menu setup](/img/theme/social-profile-menu-theme-location.png)

Assigned to this theme location, the theme will automatically transform the menu into a set of icons matching your social media profiles.

## <a name="photo-gallery"></a> How can I create a photo gallery that opens in a lightbox like the demo?

WordPress supports great photo galleries right out of the box and this theme displays them beautifully. I like them so much that I wrote a [step-by-step guide on how to add photo galleries](http://themeofthecrop.com/2015/12/08/creating-photo-galleries-the-wordpress-way/) to your pages and posts.

This theme integrates with the free [WP Featherlight](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-featherlight/) plugin. When [installed and activated](/{{ site.data[page.slug].base}}/user/getting-started/activate-plugins), it will open your images in a lightbox for dramatic effect.

## <a name="full-width-page-template"></a> Can I hide the sidebar on just one page?

This theme includes a full-width page template. It's great for pages where you want to focus on one piece of content -- like a photo gallery or your booking form.

To make use of this template, go to the **Pages > Add New** page in your WordPress admin area. On the page editing screen, find the **Page Attributes** box on the right, below the publish button.

![Screenshot of the custom page template box](/img/theme/full-width-page-template.png)

Set the **Template** option to *Full Width* then preview the page and you'll see the sidebar is gone.

*Want to hide the sidebar everywhere? Remove all the widgets from it under __Appearance > Sidebar__ and it will go away.*

## <a name="css-changes"></a> Can I make changes to the CSS styles?

There are several ways you can add your own CSS code. But the **worst way** is to edit the theme files directly. Any changes you make to the theme's files will get overwritten the next time the theme is updated.

Here are two methods I often recommend, depending on your skill level.

1. *The Recommended Way*<br>
 Use a **Child Theme**. Along with the download link for the theme in your purchase receipt, you also received a download link for an empty child theme. I strongly urge you to activate the child theme instead of the base theme. You can add CSS styles to the `style.css` file and they'll automatically get loaded. Learn about the [many benefits](http://themeofthecrop.com/2015/11/26/using-child-themes-to-customize-your-site/) of using a child theme.

2. *The Easiest Way*<br>
 If you only need to add a few lines of CSS code to your site, you can use a plugin like [Simple Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/). It will give you a text box in your WordPress admin area where you can copy and paste CSS code to load it on your site.

## <a name="support"></a> How do I contact support?

I'm here to help. Don't hesitate to reach out and [ask for support](http://themeofthecrop.com/about/support/) if you're struggling with anything.

## <a name="refund"></a> Can I get a refund?

I offer a **_30-day money-back guarantee_**. If you can't use your purchase [request a refund](http://themeofthecrop.com/about/support/).

And let me know why. I won't make you answer a survey and I won't beg you to stay. But I **_really_** want to know if I failed to meet your expectations.

## <a name="more-help"></a> I'm in over my head. Where can I get more hands-on help?

I do my best to help every customer use any of my products. But you may need more dedicated help than I'm able to provide.

If you need **a helping hand** when building your restaurant, cafe or bar website, take a look at [WP Site Care](http://www.wpsitecare.com/). They provide on-going support and maintenance, including advice when you're having trouble, audits to improve your website performance and SEO, and more.

If you need **custom code development** to add a feature or make more significant alterations to the theme, take a look at [codeable.io](https://codeable.io/). They match your needs with qualified freelance developers who can take on small and large customization projects.

All you need to get started taking bookings is add the booking form to your website. There are three ways you can do this.

1. Automatically add the booking form to any page on your website. Go to the **Bookings > Settings** page in your admin dashboard. Select one of your pages in the dropdown list for **Booking Page**. The booking form will automatically be added to that page.

2. Add the Booking Form widget to any sidebar. Go to **Appearance > Widgets** and find the Booking Form widget. Add it to any sidebar to display your booking form there.

3. Use the `[booking-form]` shortcode to add your booking form to any page or post on your website. Simply copy and paste `[booking-form]` into the content of any page or post.

Once the form is appearing on your site, you're ready to go!

You can move on to start [managing your bookings](../manage) or learn more about [configuring your booking schedule, customizing email notifications, and more](../config).

You may need a menu layout that is more complex than a one- or two-column layout. When these situations arise, there are a few paths you can take.

The following tutorials will give you creative solutions to your restaurant needs.

[Create a complex menu layout](http://themeofthecrop.com/2014/07/31/achieve-complex-menu-layouts-food-drink-menu/) by nesting menus in a grid using a simple grid columns shortcode plugin.

[Give each section of your menu a unique style](http://themeofthecrop.com/2014/08/19/give-section-restaurant-menu-unique-style/) by targeting it with specific CSS rules.

And if you are comfortable modifying code templates, you can also [customize the menu templates](http://themeofthecrop.com/2014/01/28/customize-restaurant-menu-templates/).

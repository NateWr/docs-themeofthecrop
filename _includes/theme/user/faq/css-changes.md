## <a name="css-changes"></a> Can I make changes to the CSS styles?

There are several ways you can add your own CSS code. But the **worst way** is to edit the theme files directly. Any changes you make to the theme's files will get overwritten the next time the theme is updated.

Here are two methods I often recommend, depending on your skill level.

1. *The Recommended Way*<br>
 Use a **Child Theme**. Along with the download link for the theme in your purchase receipt, you also received a download link for an empty child theme. I strongly urge you to activate the child theme instead of the base theme. You can add CSS styles to the `style.css` file and they'll automatically get loaded.

2. *The Easiest Way*<br>
 If you only need to add a few lines of CSS code to your site, you can use a plugin like [Simple Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/). It will give you a text box in your WordPress admin area where you can copy and paste CSS code to load it on your site.
